  <p>
    Hello! I'm a 2nd year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student majoring in Web and Mobile Application (BSIT-WMA). I’m passionate about web development, design, and creating user-friendly digital experiences. I enjoy learning new technologies, working on hands-on projects, and continuously improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and front-end frameworks.</p>
  <p>
  In my free time, I like solving coding challenges, and building personal websites to apply and expand my knowledge. I find joy in turning creative ideas into functional web interfaces, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient code. I believe that good design and usability go hand-in-hand with strong technical skills.</p>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, I aspire to become a full-stack developer and contribute to impactful tech solutions. I'm currently working on improving my JavaScript and exploring back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases. Whether it's through academic projects or personal learning, I'm committed to growing in this field and staying up-to-date with the latest tools and trends in the web development industry.
